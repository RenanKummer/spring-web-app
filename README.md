# Spring Web App
This is a tutorial project from **Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru** course [available at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru). The goal is to introduce beginners to Spring Framework 5 with a simple web application.

## Hints
- Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io) to setup your project.
- Spring Boot contains _starters_ to group dependencies for common scenarios. The repositories are [available at GitHub](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-starters).
  - This is a useful practice to be had in any complex system.
